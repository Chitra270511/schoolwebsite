            Academically, RVK follows CCE(Continuous Cumulative Evaluation) pattern of education. Kids have no exams til 5th, but they wil be evaluaed on a day-to-day basis. there wil be dictations, tests every day,but neither i nor my son felt the strain of getting prepared for everyday tests;  reading & writting works are given on alternative days.
            
            There wil be a session on CCE in the first PTA. As we are used to the traditional method of learning,as a parent u might feel a little disconnected in the learning process of the child. but gradually it settels.</p>
